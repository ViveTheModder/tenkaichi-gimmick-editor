# tenkaichi-gimmick-editor
A modding tool for the PS2 & Wii version of DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 2 & 3 that allows editing the ``022_gimmick_param`` or ``022_character_extra_animations`` DAT file found in character costumes, which allows model parts (like the hair ones) to move independently.

Requested by [kuxxi. (FW)](https://www.youtube.com/@kuxxi.), [BÎµzzo](https://www.youtube.com/@BezzoIsTaken) and [Deelseton](https://www.youtube.com/@Deelseton)... talk about popular demand.

The ``022_gimmick_param.dat`` file has nearly no research, so even though it contains particular bytes & shorts, the tool only supports editing the floats in that file, since they are the most important.

# Demonstration
The tool works with both ``022_gimmick_param.dat`` and character costume files.

It can also import data from other PAK or ``022_gimmick_param.dat`` files.

And with the release of v1.3, better error handling has been added.
